# Data-Engineering-Project using Flask Framework
Developed a web-based search engine automation tool using Python Flask and MySQL, automating web searches across multiple search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Dogpile) with Selenium for web scraping and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content.

Built a Flask-based web application with a user-friendly GUI that allows users to input search terms, scrape search results, and store URLs in a MySQL database. Implemented an ETL process to filter out ads, remove duplicate URLs, and rank search results by frequency.

Integrated Python scripts to take automated screenshots of search results, apply OCR for data extraction, and perform frequency analysis on search terms across multiple search engines, providing ranked URLs based on term occurrence.
